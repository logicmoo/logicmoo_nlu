THE FRACAS TEXTUAL INFERENCE PROBLEM SET
=================================================================================

The textual inference problems contained in this file are derived from the
FraCaS project undertaken in the mid-1990s.  The source document is:

    "Using the Framework"
    The FraCaS Consortium
    Cooper et al.
    January 1996
    ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/FRACAS/del16.ps.gz

There are 346 problems.  Each problem contains one or more premises and one
question.  There are a total of 536 premises, or an average of 1.55 premises per
problem.  The premise counts are distributed as follows:

            # premises      # problems      % problems
            ----------      ----------      ----------
                1              192            55.5 %
                2              122            35.3 %
                3               29             8.4 %
                4                2             0.6 %
                5                1             0.3 %

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conversion to XML by Bill MacCartney (wcmac@cs.stanford.edu).  If you benefit
from my work, please give me appropriate credit.

Some notes on the XML representation:

The 'p' and 'q' elements:

    These contain the premises and the question from the original source
    problem.  Note that four problems are missing questions altogether.

    I have made some very minor corrections here and there, such as adding
    missing sentence-final periods.  But I've generally been reluctant to make
    other edits, even when the original is not perfectly grammatical.

The 'h' element:

    The original problems included questions, not hypotheses.  But in my work, I
    prefer to work with declarative hypotheses.  I've therefore introduced the
    'h' element, containing a sentence which is, as nearly as possible, the
    declarative equivalent to the question posed in the 'q' element.  The
    transformation from question form to declarative form was initially
    performed automatically, but all the results were manually reviewed and
    edited for correctness.  Note that in a few questions (specifically, those
    containing "any", "anyone", or "either"), it was necessary to change some
    key words to achieve grammaticality.  "Any" and "anyone" were replaced by
    "some" and "someone", while "either" was replaced by "one of the".  Problems
    38, 46, 54, 55, 62, 70, 71, 78, 107, 108, 141, 344 were affected in this
    way.

The 'a' element:

    Most problems in the source document included an answer, marked in square
    brackets.  The 'a' element shows that answer.  Most answers are "Yes",
    "Don't know", or "No", but some are longer phrases containing qualifications
    or elaborations such as "Yes, on one reading".  The answer distribution is
    roughly as follows:

        180    52%     Yes
         94    27%     Don't know
         31     9%     No
         41    12%     [other / complex]

The 'why' element:

    These elements contain text from the source document intended to explain or
    justify the answer.

The 'note' element:

    I've added notes to a number of problems in order to explain issues which
    arose during translation to XML.

The 'fracas_answer' attribute:

    To remedy the fact that the answers given in the source document are not
    restricted to a set of canonical values, most problems include a
    'fracas_answer' attribute, having one of the values {'yes', 'no', 'unknown',
    'undef'}.  In most cases, this attribute value was generated by the obvious
    mapping from the 'a' element, but for complex 'a' elements I used my own
    judgment in generating the 'answer' value.

The 'fracas_nonstandard' attribute:

    If the answer given in the source document is not one of {'Yes', 'No', or
    'Don't know'}, then the problem will include the 'fracas_nonstandard'
    attribute with value 'true'.  41 problems have this annotation.

 7 TEMPORAL REFERENCE

  Inference patterns involving temporal reference are complicated by the
  interplay between tense, aspectual information, lexical semantics, defeasible
  interpretation principles such as narrative progression, rhetorical relations,
  a theory of action and causation, world knowledge, interaction between
  plurality, genericity and temporal/aspectual phenomena etc. Some of the
  inferences are very basic, some are more involved. The more complex examples
